Bad cholesterol is not so bad. LDL (bad) cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone, the major anti-aging steroid, which is then partly converted into progesterone and DHEA. 
Circulation, the journal of the American Heart Asscn. (AHA), reported in Feb. 2006, that since statins were introduced to lower cholesterol, there has been a doubling (100%) increase in heart failure. Furthermore, a late study reveals that higher LDL (the so-called "bad" cholesterol), is "associated with decreasing mortality risk in older women." And for both older sexes, "fatal heart failure decreases with higher LDL levels." (Jnl. of the American Geriatric Society, Dec. 2005)
- Körte és alma = Pears and apples have a lot of pectin, which is a type of fiber that can lower cholesterol. So do citrus fruits like oranges and lemons. Berries are also high in fiber. Try this Pear and Red Onion Gratin as a side dish.

- Amla (indiai egres, nem alma) reduces total cholesterol (TC) level, LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) and triglyceride (TG) level. It is also known to increase High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) level.
- Magnesium (magnesium oxide, 400 mg capsules, twice a day for 60 days) has been reported to decrease total serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, and very low density lipoprotein, and increase high density lipoprotein.
